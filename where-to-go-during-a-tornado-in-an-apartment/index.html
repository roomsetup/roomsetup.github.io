Tips What to do in the event of a tornado Beaumont From beaumontenterprise.com</p>
<p>What to do during a tornado if you live in an apartment? Apartment dwellers on higher floors should seek similar shelter. Preferably, you should go to the lower areas in your high rise such as the basement. This is why you need to take cover when the warning siren goes off.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-live-on-an-upper-floor-consider-identifying-another-safe-place-to-go-in-your-apartment-complex">If you live on an upper floor, consider identifying another safe place to go in your apartment complex.</h3><p>Although there is no completely safe place during a tornado, some locations are much safer than others. A closet, bathroom or interior hall without windows is the safest spot in your apartment during a tornado. If not, get to the lowest level of your apartment building immediately. Watch for potential risks outdoors. If you live in an upstairs apartment or condo, or have neighbors that do have a basement, try to develop a good relationship with them, and discuss the possibility of seeking shelter in their apartment/house during a tornado warning. If you live in an apartment, the second floor or higher is unsafe in the event of a tornado.</p>
