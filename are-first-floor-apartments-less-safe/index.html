2 Bedroom First Floor Apartment From cwbproperty.co.uk</p>
<p>The first floor is probably ideal if you have kids, dogs, or make big grocery hauls. That said, i like to think that being so close to the street and in. You don�t have neighbors below you when you live in an upper floor unit, you have neighbors below you, hearing your every move. Unless we’re home, we don’t leave our windows open which can make it a bit stuffy.</p>
<h3 id="the-building-i-plan-to-live-at-has-an-underground-garage-so-the-first-floor-is-actually-15-floor">The building i plan to live at has an underground garage, so the first floor is actually 1.5 floor.</h3><p>Safety on the first floor comes with a significant win. That said, i like to think that being so close to the street and in. These types of apartments tend to have less natural light and, if your windows face the street, less privacy. Dangerous wind damage is usually limited to roofline areas near the tops of buildings, and windows. But the top floor has balcony i had a second floor apartment and a handicapped son , i had to carry him in and out all the time , then i started worrying about what if a fire broke out ( i had 3 children). I pay $114 a year for $40,000 replacement cost in renter�s insurance.</p>

<p>When you move out, moving things isn’t as tough. Somewhere below the top of the structure and above the two bottom floors should be safe. The first floor is probably ideal if you have kids, dogs, or make big grocery hauls. Financially, i will make $3600 a month after taxes. In fact, they have many more benefits than you might.</p>

<p>That said, i like to think that being so close to the street and in. First floor apartments may be easier to break into since the windows are at street level. Financially, i will make $3600 a month after taxes. Unless we’re home, we don’t leave our windows open which can make it a bit stuffy. Somewhere below the top.</p>

<p>There is another choice which is a third floor apartment. It is recommended to install a motion detector inside your apartment. Use interior sensors to your advantage. Dangerous wind damage is usually limited to roofline areas near the tops of buildings, and windows. I will likely make that amount until the end of may, where i will only likely make.</p>

<p>In most instances, flooding occurs on the first one or two floors of the building. The first floor is probably ideal if you have kids, dogs, or make big grocery hauls. People who live on higher floors will always be tromping in and out of the complex, and you’ll hear every bit. Unless we’re home, we don’t leave our windows.</p>

<p>Use interior sensors to your advantage. However, these units often do not provide. I lived of first floor (moved out to 3rd floor about 30 days ago) for 4 years.
