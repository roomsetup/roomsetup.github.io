<h3 id="lets-take-it-from-the-top">Let’s take it from the top.</h3><p>The hansaviertel apartments were built as part of the interbau berlin 1957 exhibition, which aimed to plan a new city district in the area north of tiergarten, that had been completely destroyed during the second world war. The two architects divided up the assignment: While living in turku, aalto became acquainted with the industrialist juho tapani, who owned a company that manufactured concrete standard elements. The standard apartment building is one of the three buildings designed by aalto and realised in turku which are considered his key works leading from classicism to the functionalism. The savoy vase (created, like many of his works, alongside his wife, aino) was part of a collection of decorative items designed for ravintola savoy, an upscale restaurant in helsinki, in 1937. Since 1998, it is protected by the monument protection act.</p>
