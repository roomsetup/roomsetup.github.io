How do i split apart and rematch a TV show? What more does From reddit.com</p>
<p>I�ve looked, searched, and pulled my hair out but still nothing. I�ve confirmed that plex sees both versions, as i have the 2 in the corner of every episode. I had to unmatch the series first. Now you can play each version manually, but people just want to click play and it just work.</p>
<h3 id="pms-server-is-merging-episodes-into-a-single-entry-under-the-powerpuff-girls-and-there-is-nowhere-i-can-see-to-split-the-files">Pms server is merging episodes into a single entry under the powerpuff girls, and there is nowhere i can see to split the files.</h3><p>Then i was able to split them apart. Something that i can’t say about the plex app. I read about the option to split apart movies or tv shows, but the button is missing from the office. However this is the exact feature i am after, is there a reason why we cant do this? I click split apart and it splits them momentarily before. Here�s how to clean up your plex media library to make sure everything is in order.</p>
