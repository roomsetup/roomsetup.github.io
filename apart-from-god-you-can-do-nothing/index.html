<p>I have been putting pressure on many to make them see the foolishness of trying in their own strength to be holy. “i am the vine, ye are the branches. Whoever abides in me and i in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. For a branch cannot produce fruit if it is severed from the vine, and you cannot be fruitful unless you remain in me.</p>
<h3 id="he-says-that-without-him-we-can-do-nothing-of-eternal-significance">He says that without him, we can do nothing (of eternal significance).</h3><p>It is the man who shares my life and whose life i share who proves fruitful.for apart from me you can do nothing at all (emphasis ours throughout). Jesus� quote by myself i can do nothing in john 5:30 (how much more so can we do nothing) i am the vine; For it is god and god alone that gives the growth. But if you live your life in me, and my words live in your hearts, you can ask for whatever you like and it will [be done] for you. Perhaps you’ve heard that no one can do anything apart from jesus. Or, you may have read this phrase during leadership or evangelism training, urging your frequent communication with jesus.</p>
