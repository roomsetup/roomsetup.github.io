<p>Just because you can’t break your lease automatically doesn’t mean you can’t end it at all. I started a lease but didn�t finish it. Rules and regulations regarding the moving out notice, maintenance obligations, utility transfers, etc. In most cases, overlapping assistance is not available for public housing and other types of subsidized apartments.</p>
<h3 id="dates-need-to-be-within-the-same-month">Dates need to be within the same month</h3><p>If you rent more than one apartment, it might be worth holding two renters insurance policies, but situations like that are fairly rare (for most of us). Rules and regulations regarding the moving out notice, maintenance obligations, utility transfers, etc. If you have a week of overlapping leases, make the move easier on yourself by breaking up your moving process over the course of several days. This is a scenario i’ve dealt with myself. I have been double paying rent for a lease overlap and recently found out that the old unit is being completely renovated/gutted. Dates need to be within the same month</p>

<p>Leases cannot overlap or run concurrently. Can i get rent money back for when renovations started? The usual arrangement that i have seen, when moving in the same area, is to overlap the apartments by a few days. So you take possession of the new place on 9/25 and turn over the old place on 9/30.
