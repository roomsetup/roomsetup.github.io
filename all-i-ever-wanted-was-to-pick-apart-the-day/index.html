<p>All i ever wanted to do was pick apart the day. All i ever wanted was to pick apart the day. On the coldest afternoon on the wildest day. I want to maintain an unhealthy amount of naivety and enchantment with the world.</p>
<h3 id="i-agree-turning-on-party-chat-after-joining-party-is-dumb">I agree, turning on party chat after joining party is dumb.</h3><p>Why have i had so many unsuccessful marriages; When i thought it was right to name my desires, what i wanted of life, they seemed to turn. In my case, a guy who happens to be born in a body with female parts. Either way, i found out i�m nothing without you. Who takes it all like �uncle sam�. Someone who�s body is one gender, but their mind is another.</p>

<p>Hey dad, they always start, detailing adventures and hijinks. The opposite of trans is cis. To pick me up in your worn out shoes.
